# Uruk_Hard-Public

Hi, this was the first full fledged website I created for a friend of mine through the use of PHP, MYSQL, HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, Javascript/Jquery & NPM.

It began as a Wordpress site, but I found Wordpress to be too limiting, so I set out to remake the website from scratch. It's fully functional and I could consider it finished, although there are still some improvements/additions I'd like to make here and there.

It was originally procedurally programmed and fairly unorganised, however I've now completely reorganised the code into an MVC framework. It's not 'strict' MVC, as the controllers interact with the view and the models, but I think it's fine this way.

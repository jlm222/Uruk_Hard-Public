# Uruk_Hard-Public

Hi, this was the first full fledged website I created for a friend of mine through the use of PHP, MYSQL, HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, Javascript/Jquery & NPM.

It began as a Wordpress site, but I found Wordpress to be too limiting and so I set out to remake the website from scratch. It's fully functional and I could consider it finished, although there are still some improvements/additions I'd like to make here and there.

Once I have a better understanding of the MVC framework and OOP, I will be refactoring the site to reflect those practices.
